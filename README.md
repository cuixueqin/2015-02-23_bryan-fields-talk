Ram, K 2013. Git can facilitate greater reproducibility and increased transparency in science. Source Code for Biology and Medicine 2013 8:7. Go to the [associated github repo](https://github.com/karthikram/smb_git) to get the PDF (link at bottom of README) and to see a great example of how someone managed the process of writing a manuscript with git(hub).

Karl Broman's tutorial, aimed at stats / data science types: [An introduction to Git/Github](http://kbroman.github.io/github_tutorial/).

[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) Git client, with a GUI. Available for Windows or Mac.
